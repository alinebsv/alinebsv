- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aline Vieira. I am a Communications graduate, currently working as a dog groomer, and studying to become a Front-End Developer,
and maybe even a full stack developer in the future.
- âœ¨ I am Brazilian, living in Canada, and I have lived in Mexico prior to that.
- âœ¨ As you could probably tell from my bio, I like doing many different things, which are often completely unrelated to each other. I assure you though,
I am fully committed to all of my projects and I am extremely driven to learn and grow.
- âœ¨ Dogs are my favorite thing in the world and working with them every day has been such a privilege!
- âœ¨ I also love languages, and I speak Portuguese, English, Spanish, and I am currently learning Japanese.
- âœ¨ Besides dogs, I also love reading and playing the guitar.
- âœ¨ I am hoping to practice my skills as a developer to be able to create some of my own projects.
